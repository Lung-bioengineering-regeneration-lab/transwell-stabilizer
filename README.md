# Transwell Stabilizer

This 3D printed ring is made to stabilize the 6.5mm transwell insert in 12 well plates for the purpose of imaging. 

This insert is normally placed in 24 well plates and is lifted from the bottom of the well. The insert needs to be brought closer to the bottom of the well during imaging, therefore we place it in a 12 well plate. However, in order for the transwell to sit exactly at the center of the well it needs some assistance. 

Once 3D printed, this ring can be easily disinfected with 70% EtOH.
